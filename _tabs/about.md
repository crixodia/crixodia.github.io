Welcome to this space where the love for learning and computer science converge! I'm Cristian Bastidas, a soon-to-be Computer Science graduate with an insatiable curiosity for all things tech. Whether you're a fellow student, a tech enthusiast, or just someone curious about the digital world, you've come to the right place.

This blog was born out of my desire to learn and share the fascinating world of computer science with you. It all began back in high school when I stumbled upon a piece of code on the whiteboard. I had no idea what it was, but when I hit "play," I realized I was creating a computer program. It was a simple calculator, but it was the spark that ignited my passion for coding. I knew I had to share my journey and experiences with others.

## What to Expect ü§î

Here, you'll find a diverse range of content covering Algorithms, Data Structures, AI/ML, and invaluable tips for students and professionals. Expect tutorials that demystify complex concepts, in-depth explanations that make learning a breeze, and recommendations to enhance your tech arsenal. My blog is a compilation of experiences I wish I had known sooner - a treasure trove of insights for those embarking on a similar journey.

## The Crixodia's Experience ü´°

One highlight you won't want to miss is a Java application I developed that lets you play with the Game of Life. It even generates animations and GIFs for added fun! I'm here to prove that learning can be a joyful activity, especially when it comes to Computer Science.
