Counting prime numbers is a fundamental problem in programming. While a classical approach is the first choice for many, the efficiency of the algorithm matters. In this blog post, we'll explore two approaches for solving this problem and compare their performance.

## Understanding Prime Numbers

Prime numbers are integers divisible only by 1 and themselves. We'll count these unique numbers within a given range.

### Classic Approach

The classic approach involves checking each number within the range to determine if it's prime. We use a simple `isPrime` function for this purpose. Here's the code:

```python
def isPrime(n:int) -> bool:
  if n <= 1:
      return False
  for i in range(2,int(sqrt(n))+1):
    if n%i == 0:
      return False
  return True

def countPrimesClassic(n:int)->int:
  c = 0
  for i in range(2,n):
    if isPrime(i):
      c+=1
  return c
```

This classic approach works, but it can be slow for large ranges.

### Sieve of Eratosthenes

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a more efficient method for counting prime numbers. It works by systematically eliminating non-prime numbers. The algorithm is as follows:

1. Create a list of consecutive integers from $$2$$ through $$n$$.
2. Start with the smallest prime number, $$p = 2$$.
3. Eliminate multiples of $$p$$ by marking them in the list.
4. Find the smallest unmarked number greater than $$p$$ and set $$p$$ to this number. Repeat from step 3.
5. When the algorithm terminates, the unmarked numbers are prime below $$n$$.

Here's the code for the Sieve of Eratosthenes:

```python
from math import sqrt
def countPrimesSieve(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 2: return 0
    np, ans = [False]*n, 1
    for i in range(3, int(sqrt(n))+1, 2):
        if np[i]: continue
        for j in range(i*i, n, 2*i): np[j] = True
    for i in range(3, n, 2):
        if not np[i]: ans += 1
    return ans
```

## Performance Comparison

To compare the performance of these algorithms, we ran tests from 1 to 5000 with 5 samples at each iteration. The results are clear: the Sieve of Eratosthenes is faster.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes takes, on average, 1 second less than the classic approach and up to 9 seconds less in the worst case.

## Conclusion

Counting prime numbers is a valuable exercise in algorithm design. While this problem may not be a professional requirement, it helps reinforce mathematical concepts and encourages efficient algorithm design. By choosing the right approach, you can optimize your code and save valuable time.
